               1.   GENERAL  

               

                  1.1 PURPOSE  

                  This  Guideline  defines the test procedure and identification required for a program of Positive  
                  Material Identification (PMI) for use by CONTRACTORs, Consultants, Sub-Contractor’s, Vendors,  
                  Suppliers performing work in all ADNOC and ADNOC Group company’s Projects. This Guideline  
                  applies to metallic alloy materials purchased for use either directly by the COMPANY or indirectly  
                  through vendors, fabricators, or contractors and includes the supply, fabrication, and erection of  
                  these materials.  This Guideline applies to all levels of Sub-vendors and Sub-Contractors in the  
                  Supply Chain  

                  This Guideline  provides the requirements for material control and material verification programs  
                  on ferrous and nonferrous alloys during the construction, installation, maintenance, and inspection  
                  of new equipment, process piping systems and Welds.  

                  This Guideline covers the Procedures and Methodology to be adopted to assure that the metallic  
                  alloy material components which affect the pressure envelope of pressure containing equipment  
                  or piping, Non Pressure containing equipment or piping and reliability of all such equipment and  
                  piping  is  consistent  with  the  Material  Specifications  as  specified  in  Project  Specifications,  
                  Datasheets  and  Drawings.  This  minimizes  the  potential  for  premature  problems  or  failure  of  
                  equipment and component.  

                  The test methods outlined in this  Guideline  are intended to identify alloy materials and are not  
                  intended to establish the exact conformance of a material to a particular alloy Specification.  PMI  
                  shall not be considered as a substitute for required Material test  Certificate  and Material Test  
                  Certificates shall not be considered as acceptable PMI.  

                  1.2 SCOPE  

                  This Guideline shall be implemented to reinforce those procedures, which are normally used to  
                  identify and control alloy materials during equipment fabrication and installation. The term Alloy  
                  with context of Ferrous Material excludes Plain Carbon steels and Low Temperature Carbon Steel  
                  (LTCS) but includes other Alloy steel like  1¼  Cr, 2Cr,5 Cr,  Stainless Steels,  Duplex and Super  
                  Duplex  etc.  Ferrous  Alloys  requiring  testing  include  Nickel  Alloys  and  Copper  Alloys.    Any  
                  deviation  from  this  Guideline  shall  be  identified  by  CONTRACTOR  and  shall  require  written  
                  approval from COMPANY.  

                  This document is mandatory and applicable for implementation in the project execution phase  
                  onwards  from the Invitation  to  Tender (ITT),  Front  End  Engineering  Design  (FEED),  Detailed  
                  Engineering, Procurement, and Site Construction, until Pre-Commissioning.   

                  In  this  Guideline,  the  term  CONTRACTOR  includes  all  Sub-Contractor’s,  Suppliers,  Vendors,  
                  Consultant’s or any entity who is responsible for delivering some or all parts of the contract scope  
                  of work.

                       6.   On existing piping at tie-ins of new piping to existing prior to welding in the field.  
                         

                  Any  Pressure  retaining piping  bulk  material procured from  stockist  or  distributor  shall  be  PMI  
                  tested at the Stockist / distributor Warehouse in addition to the above.  

                    

                  The CONTRACTOR QC inspector approved by Company shall witness the PMI Testing. The CV  
                  of the technician performing the PMI shall be approved by Company.    

                  It  is  recommended  that  the  PMI  verification  testing  performed  by  the  VENDOR  prior  to  final

                  For bulk piping components, prior PMI testing at various stages of procurement and subassembly  
                  may also be beneficial. However, this does not negate the requirement of testing after fabrication.   

                  PMI testing shall be performed prior to post weld heat treatment (Unless approved otherwise by  
                  COMPANY). PMI shall be carried out prior to Painting.

                 A quality plan shall be established by CONTRACTOR to prevent the inadvertent use of materials  
                 failing to pass PMI testing. COMPANY shall approve the quality plan.   

                 The CONTRACTOR will develop a table summarizing the extent of testing, component requiring  
                 testing, and the type of colour code and marking.  

                 The COMPANY may choose to have a third party inspector present at or perform any of the PMI  
                 testing.   

                 Unless otherwise noted in contract document, non-ferrous materials ( titanium, aluminium, etc.)  
                 other than nickel alloys and Copper Alloys do not require PMI testing.   

                 A  project  Specific  PMI  procedure  shall  be  developed  as  deliverable  by  CONTRACTOR  and  
                 submitted  to  COMPANY  for  approval.  Further  each  Sub-Contractor,  Vendor,  Sub-Vendor,  
                 Manufacturer       shall    submit     the   PMI     procedure      as    a   deliverable     for   approval     by  
                 CONTRACTOR/COMPANY. Refer section 11 of this Guideline.  

                 Welds:  

                 Pressure-containing full penetration welds and tee joints, and fillet welds of slip-on  flanges in  
                 equipment and piping made with alloy welding consumables shall be PMI tested in accordance  
                 with the following guidelines:  

                 Selection of the test point locations to be examined shall be made by CONTRACTOR.  

                  1.  For piping, 100% of welds per completed pipe spool shall be PMI tested.   
                 2.   For fabricated equipment, 100% of pressure welds shall be PMI tested.  

                  In addition, all alloy-welding consumables shall be PMI checked in the original supply condition  
                 per Manufacturer/Trade name / Batch No. The method of PMI shall be subject to CONTRACTOR  
                 / COMPANY approval.  

                 PMI Testing of Welding Consumables:  

                 When the welding activity conducted, one electrode or wire sample from each lot or package of  
                 alloy weld rod shall be subject to PMI testing. The remainder of the lot shall compare with sample  
                 to verify that the markings of the wires/electrodes are correct. Some weld rods have the alloying  
                 elements contained in the flux, and do not meet the alloy Specification  until welded. PMI testing  
                 of weld metal (e.g. deposited weld metal or undiluted weld “buttons”) is a permissible alternative  
                 to  PMI  testing  of  an  electrode  or  wire  sample  provided  it  is  conducted  immediately  prior  to  
                 production welding.  

               7.  MATERIAL IDENTIFICATION  

                 After PMI testing has been successfully completed, each pipe or equipment component shall be  
                 marked to identify the alloy type (i.e. PMI 1¼ Cr, 2Cr,5 Cr, etc).   

                 The preferred marking methods are low stress stamps or Vibra-etch. Other marking methods  
                 require CONTRACTOR agreement and authorization.

                  otherwise noted, a portable alloy  analyser  “match” of material is accepted as verification of an  
                  alloy material. If a clear match is not made, then the alloying elements specified in Appendix B for  
                  each  individual  alloy  shall  be  verified  by  PMI  testing  and  the  results  submitted  to  the  
                  CONTRACTOR  and  COMPANY.  The  test  results  shall  be  within  the  range  specified  by  the  
                  applicable material standard.   

                  For weld metal, Acceptance criteria shall be in accordance with the applicable AWS standard or  
                  ASME  SEC  II  Part  C  (as  applicable)  for  welding  consumables  or  an  agreed  analysis  range  
                  approved by CONTRACTOR & COMPANY.   

                  When specifically noted that PMI testing of carbon content for low carbon (“L”) or high carbon (“H”)  
                  grades of stainless steel  material shall be conducted, carbon content shall be verified by optical  
                  emission or wet chemical analysis.   

                  Dissimilar Metal Welds and Weld Overlays Results from testing dissimilar metal welds should  
                  take into account the effects of dilution, which occurs during weld deposition. The Contractor  
                  should  establish  the  minimum  compositional  requirements  of  the  as-deposited  weld  metal  
                  necessary for the intended service for Company approval.   

                  Components or welds which are found to comply with applicable material Specification shall  be  
                  accepted. Acceptance or rejection shall take into account the accuracy of the PMI  equipment  
                  used. The individual element determined for identification in Appendix B for selected alloys shall  
                  be within the range specified by the applicable material standard.

                    If any of the major alloying elements are below the range specified by the applicable material  
                    standard or a portable analyzer indicates an incorrect match or “no match”, the component shall  
                    be rejected or a laboratory analysis may be performed at no additional cost to the COMPANY.  
                    The laboratory analysis will determine acceptance or rejection of the material.   
                      
                    Note: (Portable analyzer match of material is basis of acceptance).   
                      
                    If  any  of  the  major  alloying  elements  are  greater  than  the  range  specified  by  the  applicable  
                    material  standard,  the  alloy  content  must  be  reported  to  CONTRACTOR  for  acceptance  or  
                    rejection.   
                      
                    A  detailed  Chemical  analysis  may  be  performed  in  a  laboratory for the materials  having  very  
                    nominal deviation of Alloying Elements from the acceptable limits. Both the nominal deviation and  
                    the final laboratory analysis shall be reported. ln such cases a final decision to accept or reject is  
                    left to the COMPANY.

                                 and/or Sub-VENDOR’s cost.  
                        ii.      Upon discovery of a second item not traceable to a PMI report and MTC, a NCR shall  
                                 be  issued.  All  rejected  materials  that  are  identified  shall  be  quarantined  until  an  
                                 investigation is carried out.  

                13. REJECTED MATERIALS  

                   Rejected  material  shall  be  identified  by  marking  or  tagging  and  segregated  from  acceptable  
                   material.  
                     
                   The VENDOR / SUPPLIER / SUB VENDOR / SUB-CONTRCTOR, as applicable, shall submit a  
                   non-conformance report (NCR) per the project quality procedures.   
                     
                   Materials and welds found to be incorrect on field-fabricated pipe spools or equipment shall be  
                   replaced  at  the  Field  CONTRACTOR  /  SUB  CONTRACTOR,  VENDOR  /  SUPPLIER  /  SUB  
                   VENDOR expense. Following replacement, PMI shall be conducted on all replaced components  
                   and associated welds.   
                     
                   If any piece, or weld from a representative percentage sample is found to be unacceptable, then  
                   the remainder of that material heat number or all welds on a completed pipe spool or equipment  
                   item (as applicable) shall be verified by performing a 100% PMI test at the VENDOR / SUPPLIER  
                   / SUB VENDOR or CONTRACTOR / SUB-CONTRACTOR expense.   
                     
                   When traceability of a material heat number cannot be established back to the mill certification or  
                   other  positive  means  of  identity,  that  material  heat  number,  regardless  of  quantity,  shall  be  
                   rejected.
